                    <h2>Facts About Dogs</h2>
                    <p>
                        Dogs have a sense of time but don’t understand the ‘concept’ of time.
                        Unlike humans, dogs don’t have the ability to create actual measures of time,
                        like the second, hour, and minute, and they don’t know how to read clocks.
                        So, telling them ”I’ll be back in 15 minutes” won’t really do much, but we understand
                        that you feel like you have to do it anyway! Dogs are capable of being trained based on
                        past events, and can be taught to anticipate future events based on past experiences.
                        Pavlov’s dogs are the perfect example of this.

                        The dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog,
                        it is derived from extinct Pleistocene wolves, and the modern wolf is the dog's
                        nearest living relative. Dogs were the first species to be domesticated by
                        hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago before the development of agriculture.

                    <h2>Facts About Cats</h2>
                    <p>
                        Cats are the most popular pet in the world, with over 600 million cats worldwide.
                        They have been domesticated for around 4,000 years and are known for their independence,
                        agility, and playful behavior. Cats communicate through a variety of vocalizations,
                        body language, and scent marking. They are also known for their grooming habits,
                        spending a significant portion of their day cleaning themselves. Cats are natural hunters,
                        and their hunting instincts are still strong, even in domesticated cats. They can be trained
                        to perform tricks and respond to commands, although they are often more independent than dogs.
                        Cats have a unique ability to purr, which is often associated with contentment, but can also
                        indicate pain or distress. They are generally solitary animals, but can form strong bonds with 
                        human companions and other pets in the household.

                        The cat is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated
                        species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it
                        from wild members of the family. A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat, or a feral cat;
                        the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact. Cats are known for their agility and 
                        playful behavior, often engaging in hunting-like activities even when well-fed. They have a
                        keen sense of hearing and sight, which makes them effective hunters.
